# How to contribute to OpenDSR
Firstly, thank you for your interest and contribution! Here is a quick set of guidelines for contributing. These are guidelines and not hard and fast rules, please use your best judgement.

Here are a few other OpenDSR resources:
- Website: OpenDSR.org
- Public Slack group: OpenDSR.slack.com

## Questions about the spec or how certain cases are handled?
- Search the repositories issues (open and closed) and the wiki to see if it has been discussed already.
- Hop into the Slack channel and chat with us, someone will help you out.
- Please don't open new issues for simple questions, asking in Slack is much faster

## Have you implemented the OpenDSR spec and want to spread the word?
Awesome! Add your company name to the SUPPORTERS.md and it will get pulled into the website.

## Have a suggested improvement or fix?
- Open a new pull request with your improvement.
- Be sure to write a thorough description.
- Be sure to update all files as needed: readme, specification, etc.

## Have a major change you want to make?
- Open a new issue and propose the idea to get positive feedback before spending lots of time on edits.
- Once you've got some support, make your changes and submit a pull request.

## Curious about how the spec is authored or want to make changes to the operating model?
- Submit a pull request to the operating_model.md  and it will be reviewed in the same fashion as the spec.
